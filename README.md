It's a Good or Bad game that uses the original RuboCop documentation.

Basically, it uses the `@bad` and `@good` from YARD documentation,
dump everything into a JSON file and allow us to play with all cops
documentation randomically.

I used this [gist](https://gist.github.com/jonatas/f4e72588ecd8eefddf5fb26fb990ae22) to create the [data/cops.json](data/cops.json) from the original [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) project.
